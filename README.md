Python bits

Timesheets.py finds a file in a specified directory with the filename matching the date of the Monday of the given week.
For example, if you ran the script on Friday the 21st August 2020, it would find the file 17082020.xlsx.

Depending on your username it finds your section in the timesheet and populates the fields with times you've specified

Just a bit of fun automating a repetitive task :)
